        "Healthcare is essential for a healthy existence. Scheduling a doctor's appointment for each health concern, however, could be incredibly difficult. Statistics show that most people already have heart or lung illness, even though many report never having been to a doctor. Most people do not have the medical knowledge to assess or diagnose their health issues accurately. In advanced human-computer interaction, natural language processing research is creating natural interaction modes like chatbots. Corporate and commercial applications are using chatbots to answer user enquiries in natural language. The objective is to create an artificial intelligence-powered medical chatbot that can diagnose illnesses and offer guidance on how to manage them effectively prior to the need for direct consultation with a physician. The suggested chatbot model acquires information about their health and then provides personalized responses and suggestions for dealing with each user's health issues while lowering healthcare expenses.",

        "The artificial intelligence (AI) systems used for diagnosing ophthalmic diseases have significantly progressed in recent years. The diagnosis of difficult eye conditions, such as cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and retinopathy of prematurity, has become significantly less complicated as a result of the development of AI algorithms, which are currently on par with ophthalmologists in terms of their level of effectiveness. However, in the context of building AI systems for medical applications such as identifying eye diseases, addressing the challenges of safety and trustworthiness is paramount, including the emerging threat of adversarial attacks. Research has increasingly focused on understanding and mitigating these attacks, with numerous articles discussing this topic in recent years. As a starting point for our discussion, we used the paper by Ma et al. “Understanding Adversarial Attacks on Deep Learning Based Medical Image Analysis Systems”. A literature review was performed for this study, which included a thorough search of open-access research papers using online sources (PubMed and Google). The research provides examples of unique attack strategies for medical images. Unfortunately, unique algorithms for attacks on the various ophthalmic image types have yet to be developed. It is a task that needs to be performed. As a result, it is necessary to build algorithms that validate the computation and explain the findings of artificial intelligence models. In this article, we focus on adversarial attacks, one of the most well-known attack methods, which provide evidence (i.e., adversarial examples) of the lack of resilience of decision models that do not include provable guarantees. Adversarial attacks have the potential to provide inaccurate findings in deep learning systems and can have catastrophic effects in the healthcare industry, such as healthcare financing fraud and wrong diagnosis.",

        "To an extent as never before in the history of medicine, computers are supporting human input, decision making and provision of data. In today’s healthcare sector and medical profession, AI, algorithms, robotics and big data are used to derive inferences for monitoring large-scale medical trends, detecting and measuring individual risks and chances based on data-driven estimations. A knowledge-intensive industry like the healthcare profession highly depends on data and analytics to improve therapies and practices. In recent years, there has been tremendous growth in the range of medical information collected, including clinical, genetic, behavioral and environmental data. Every day, healthcare professionals, biomedical researchers and patients produce vast amounts of data from an array of devices. These include electronic health records (EHRs), genome sequencing machines, high-resolution medical imaging, smartphone applications and ubiquitous sensing, as well as Internet of Things (IoT) devices that monitor patient health (OECD 2015). Through machine learning algorithms and unprecedented data storage and computational power, AI technologies have most advanced abilities to gain information, process it and give a well-defined output to the end-user. Daily monitoring thereby aids to create big data to recognize behavioral patterns’ relation to health status in order to create predictions with highest mathematical precision based on big data capturing large-scale samples. AI thereby enlightens to analyze the relation between prevention and treatment and patient outcomes in all stages of diagnosis, treatment, drug development and monitoring, personalized medicine, patient control and care. Advanced hospitals are looking into AI solutions to support and perform operational initiatives that increase precision and cost effectiveness. Robotics have been used for disabled and patient care assistance. Medical decision making has been supported through predictive analytics and general healthcare management technology. Network connectivity allows access to affordable healthcare around the globe in a cost-effective way.",

        "Background There is no doubt that the recent surge in artificial intelligence (AI) research will change the trajectory of next-generation health care, making it more approachable and accessible to patients. Therefore, it is critical to research patient perceptions and outcomes because this trend will allow patients to be the primary consumers of health technology and decision makers for their own health. Objective This study aimed to review and analyze papers on AI-based consumer health informatics (CHI) for successful future patient-centered care. Methods We searched for all peer-reviewed papers in PubMed published in English before July 2022. Research on an AI-based CHI tool or system that reports patient outcomes or perceptions was identified for the scoping review. Results We identified 20 papers that met our inclusion criteria. The eligible studies were summarized and discussed with respect to the role of the AI-based CHI system, patient outcomes, and patient perceptions. The AI-based CHI systems identified included systems in mobile health (13/20, 65%), robotics (5/20, 25%), and telemedicine (2/20, 10%). All the systems aimed to provide patients with personalized health care. Patient outcomes and perceptions across various clinical disciplines were discussed, demonstrating the potential of an AI-based CHI system to benefit patients. Conclusions This scoping review showed the trend in AI-based CHI systems and their impact on patient outcomes as well as patients’ perceptions of these systems. Future studies should also explore how clinicians and health care professionals perceive these consumer-based systems and integrate them into the overall workflow.",

        "Objectives Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are developing very rapidly in the medical field, but have yet to be actively used in actual clinical settings. Ensuring reliability is essential to disseminating technologies, necessitating a wide range of research and subsequent social consensus on requirements for trustworthy AI. Methods This review divided the requirements for trustworthy medical AI into explainability, fairness, privacy protection, and robustness, investigated research trends in the literature on AI in healthcare, and explored the criteria for trustworthy AI in the medical field. Results Explainability provides a basis for determining whether healthcare providers would refer to the output of an AI model, which requires the further development of explainable AI technology, evaluation methods, and user interfaces. For AI fairness, the primary task is to identify evaluation metrics optimized for the medical field. As for privacy and robustness, further development of technologies is needed, especially in defending training data or AI algorithms against adversarial attacks. Conclusions In the future, detailed standards need to be established according to the issues that medical AI would solve or the clinical field where medical AI would be used. Furthermore, these criteria should be reflected in AI-related regulations, such as AI development guidelines and approval processes for medical devices.",

        "A significant study has been undertaken in the areas of health care and administration of cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) technologies throughout the previous decade. Healthcare professionals studied smart gadgets and other medical technologies, along with the AI-based Internet of Things (IoT) (AIoT). Connecting the two regions makes sense in terms of improving care for rural and isolated resident individuals. The healthcare industry has made tremendous strides in efficiency, affordability, and usefulness as a result of new research options and major cost reductions. This includes instructions (AIoT-based) medical advancements can be both beneficial and detrimental. While the IoT concept undoubtedly offers a number of benefits, it also poses fundamental security and privacy concerns regarding medical data. However, resource-constrained AIoT devices are vulnerable to a number of assaults, which can significantly impair their performance. Cryptographic algorithms used in the past are inadequate for safeguarding IoT-enabled networks, presenting substantial security risks. The AIoT is made up of three layers: perception, network, and application, all of which are vulnerable to security threats. These threats can be aggressive or passive in nature, and they can originate both within and outside the network. Numerous IoT security issues, including replay, sniffing, and eavesdropping, have the ability to obstruct network communication. The AIoT-H application is likely to be explored in this research article due to its potential to aid with existing and different technologies, as well as bring useful solutions to healthcare security challenges. Additionally, every day, several potential problems and inconsistencies with the AIoT-H technique have been discovered.",

Each function in machine learning and data mining techniques is built through characteristics and features.As a part of prognosis, information must be separated from patient data and information retrieved in stored databases and comparative records. For any disease, early diagnosis or diagnosis will determine the chances of a correct recovery. Disease prediction therefore becomes a more important task to support physicians in delivering efficient treatment to people.In health care, data is being created and disposed of at an extraordinary rate compared to the health care sectors. Data for medical profiling is often found in a variety of sources such as electronic health records, lab and imaging systems, doctor notes and accounts.
