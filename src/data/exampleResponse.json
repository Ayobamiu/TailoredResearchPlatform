      "title": "Nursing Care Systematization with Case-Based Reasoning and Artificial Intelligence",
      "abstract": "Of the most popular applications of artificial intelligence (AI), those used in the health sector are the ones that represent the largest proportion, in terms of use and expectation. An investigative systematization model is proposed in the scientific training of nursing professionals, by articulating epistemological positions from previous studies on the subject. In order to validate the model proposed, a prototype was created to present an application that could help nurses in their clinical processes, storing their experiences in a case base for future research. The prototype consisted of digitizing paediatric nursing diagnoses and inserting them into a case base in order to assess the effectiveness of the prototype in handling these cases in a structure conducive to retrieval, adaptation, indexing, and case comparison. This work presents as a result a computational tool for the health area, employing one of the artificial intelligence techniques, case-based reasoning (CBR). The small governmental nursing education institution in Bangladesh used in this study did not yet have the systemization of nursing care (NCS) and computerized support scales.",

While there is considerable potential for AI to augment clinical practice, there remain numerous practical implications that must be considered when exploring AI solutions. These range from ethical concerns about algorithmic bias to legislative concerns in an uncertain regulatory environment. In the absence of established protocols and examples of best practice, there is a growing need for clear guidance both for innovators and early adopters. Broadly, there are three stages to the innovation process: invention, development and implementation. In this paper, we present key considerations for innovators at each stage and offer suggestions along the AI development pipeline, from bench to bedside.",

      "title": "Artificial Intelligence Applications in Health Care Practice: Scoping Review",
      "abstract": "Background Artificial intelligence (AI) is often heralded as a potential disruptor that will transform the practice of medicine. The amount of data collected and available in health care, coupled with advances in computational power, has contributed to advances in AI and an exponential growth of publications. However, the development of AI applications does not guarantee their adoption into routine practice. There is a risk that despite the resources invested, benefits for patients, staff, and society will not be realized if AI implementation is not better understood. Objective The aim of this study was to explore how the implementation of AI in health care practice has been described and researched in the literature by answering 3 questions: What are the characteristics of research on implementation of AI in practice? What types and applications of AI systems are described? What characteristics of the implementation process for AI systems are discernible? Methods A scoping review was conducted of MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases to identify empirical studies of AI implementation in health care since 2011, in addition to snowball sampling of selected reference lists. Using Rayyan software, we screened titles and abstracts and selected full-text articles. Data from the included articles were charted and summarized. Results Of the 9218 records retrieved, 45 (0.49%) articles were included. The articles cover diverse clinical settings and disciplines; most (32/45, 71%) were published recently, were from high-income countries (33/45, 73%), and were intended for care providers (25/45, 56%). AI systems are predominantly intended for clinical care, particularly clinical care pertaining to patient-provider encounters. More than half (24/45, 53%) possess no action autonomy but rather support human decision-making. The focus of most research was on establishing the effectiveness of interventions (16/45, 35%) or related to technical and computational aspects of AI systems (11/45, 24%). Focus on the specifics of implementation processes does not yet seem to be a priority in research, and the use of frameworks to guide implementation is rare. Conclusions Our current empirical knowledge derives from implementations of AI systems with low action autonomy and approaches common to implementations of other types of information systems. To develop a specific and empirically based implementation framework, further research is needed on the more disruptive types of AI systems being implemented in routine care and on aspects unique to AI implementation in health care, such as building trust, addressing transparency issues, developing explainable and interpretable solutions, and addressing ethical concerns around privacy and data protection.",

      "title": "Artificial Intelligence for Automatic Pain Assessment: Research Methods and Perspectives",
      "abstract": "Although proper pain evaluation is mandatory for establishing the appropriate therapy, self-reported pain level assessment has several limitations. Data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) methods can be employed for research on automatic pain assessment (APA). The goal is the development of objective, standardized, and generalizable instruments useful for pain assessment in different clinical contexts. The purpose of this article is to discuss the state of the art of research and perspectives on APA applications in both research and clinical scenarios. Principles of AI functioning will be addressed. For narrative purposes, AI-based methods are grouped into behavioral-based approaches and neurophysiology-based pain detection methods. Since pain is generally accompanied by spontaneous facial behaviors, several approaches for APA are based on image classification and feature extraction. Language features through natural language strategies, body postures, and respiratory-derived elements are other investigated behavioral-based approaches. Neurophysiology-based pain detection is obtained through electroencephalography, electromyography, electrodermal activity, and other biosignals. Recent approaches involve multimode strategies by combining behaviors with neurophysiological findings. Concerning methods, early studies were conducted by machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine, decision tree, and random forest classifiers. More recently, artificial neural networks such as convolutional and recurrent neural network algorithms are implemented, even in combination. Collaboration programs involving clinicians and computer scientists must be aimed at structuring and processing robust datasets that can be used in various settings, from acute to different chronic pain conditions. Finally, it is crucial to apply the concepts of explainability and ethics when examining AI applications for pain research and management.",
